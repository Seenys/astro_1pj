# Article #1

This is the first article in the blog. It's a markdown file located in `src/pages/blog/article.md`.

You can use markdown to write your articles. Astro will render them as HTML.

You can also use Astro components, like `<Card />`, to add more interactivity to your articles.

For example, here's a card component:

```astro
<Card title="Hello, Astro!">
  <p>This is a card component.</p>
</Card>
```
